              <p class="leading-relaxed">When disasters hit, they can mean days to weeks without power, and sometimes they allow just enough time to grab a bag of supplies and go.
                 Now is the time to prepare, well before the disaster is on your doorstep.
                 A disaster supply kit contains basic items that your household may need.
                 Ready.gov, the U.S. governmentâ€™s disaster preparedness website, suggests packing the following items:<br>
                <br>
                <li>Remain calm. Although emergencies require rapid action, the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm.
                    If you find yourself becoming confused or anxious, stop what you're doing.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Determine the nature of the emergency. What signs indicate that there is an emergency? Is this a medical emergency, or is there a threat to the property/building that may result in human injury?
                     It's important to stop and take inventory of the situation calmly before reacting to the emergency.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Know that sudden changes can be emergencies. Chemical spills, fires, breaking water pipes, electrical outages, natural disasters such as floods or fires are all examples of potential workplace emergencies.
                    If you have advanced warning of the possibility of an emergency, such as the warning of a flood, heavy snow, tornado, etc., you may be better prepared. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove yourself from danger. If you, or others, are at risk of being harmed, leave the situation immediately.
                     If you have an evacuation plan, follow it. Go to an area where you will be safe.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Help others leave a hazardous area. If you can safely assist someone else in leaving a dangerous situation, do so.
                     If returning to the emergency situation is risky, a trained rescue person may be better equipped to retrieve anyone in harm's way.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay Informed: Listen to local news and emergency services for updates and instructions. Follow the advice of authorities, and do not return to your home or workplace until it's deemed safe.</li></p>
