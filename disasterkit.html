              <p class="leading-relaxed">When disasters hit, they can mean days to weeks without power, and sometimes they allow just enough time to grab a bag of supplies and go.
                 Now is the time to prepare, well before the disaster is on your doorstep.
                 A disaster supply kit contains basic items that your household may need.
                 Ready.gov, the U.S. governmentâ€™s disaster preparedness website, suggests packing the following items:<br>
                <br>
                <li> Water: one gallon per person per day for several days.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Food: at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food, such as canned meats and fruits.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A battery-powered or hand-crank radio.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A flashlight.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Plastic sheeting and duct tape that can help provide protection.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay Informed: Listen to local news and emergency services for updates and instructions. Follow the advice of authorities, and do not return to your home or workplace until it's deemed safe.</li></p>
