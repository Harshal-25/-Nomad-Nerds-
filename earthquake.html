              <p class="leading-relaxed">Here are some basic rules to follow during an earthquake: <br>
                <br>
                <li> Drop, Cover, and Hold On: When you feel an earthquake, drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops. If you're not near a sturdy piece of furniture, cover your head and neck with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay Indoors: Do not try to leave the building during the shaking, as it's safer to stay inside until the shaking stops and you can safely exit the building.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay Away from Windows and Objects that Can Fall: Stay away from windows, mirrors, and other objects that can break and fall. Move away from tall furniture, bookshelves, or other heavy objects that can topple over.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Turn off Gas and Electrical Appliances: If you smell gas or hear a hissing sound, turn off the gas immediately and move away from the building. Do not use matches or lighters, as they can ignite a gas leak. Also, turn off electrical appliances to prevent fires.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Be Prepared for Aftershocks: Aftershocks are common after an earthquake, so be prepared to drop, cover, and hold on again if necessary.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stay Informed: Listen to local news and emergency services for updates and instructions. Follow the advice of authorities, and do not return to your home or workplace until it's deemed safe.</li></p>
